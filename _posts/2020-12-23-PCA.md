Principal Component Analysis, PCA is a unsupervised learning technique for dimensionality reduction. What does it mean?
Imagine you have collected a dataset that has 100s of features. As you could not have kept track of all these 100+ features while collecting the dataset, there's a high chance of presence of multicollinearity in the dataset. In such case, PCA can be used to transform such as large set of variables into a smaller set while still retaining most of the information in the large set. 

## What is the basic idea of PCA ?
As it is impossible to visualize a 100-dimensional data, we will try to reduce 2D data to 1D data.
Consider our example below (figure (A)), we know that price of the house increases with increase in its area.

To reduce the data from 2D to 1D, we try to find a line on which our data points seem to lie (figure (B)), and then we project out data points onto that line. The line is chosen such that the sum of distances between the data point and its projection on the line (called projection error) is small. Thus, we create a new feature Z1 where we project our data points ((figure (C)). So now we need only one number to represent the position of the data points.

So, to reduce our data from d-dimension to k-dimension, we find 'k' vectors onto which we project our data to, so as to minimize the projection error. 


## What are the advantages of performing PCA?

- Data Compression

As we have seen in our example before we can project 2D data onto a line so that we no longer need 2 numbers to represent out data, we will need only one. Similarly, we can try to project 3D data into a 2D plane on which our data seem to lie on and we will then need only 2 numbers to represent our data points. Compressing data will allow us to run our learning algorithms faster.

- Data Visualization

Sometimes it may be useful to understand the data better by plotting it. However, it is impossible to visualise our data when we are dealing with 50+ features. In such case, PCA can help us reduce our data from 50D to 2D/3D making it easier to visualize.
