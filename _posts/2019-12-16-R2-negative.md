## Can R<sup>2</sup> value ever be negative?

In a regression model, R<sup>2</sup> determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. To know more about R-squared and it's limiations, refer to [this](https://thinkdatascience.github.io/posts/R2andAdjustedR2/) link.

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

R^2 is given by below formula:

$$ R^2 = 1 - {SS_{Regression} \over SS_{Total}} $$  
or  
$$ R^2 = 1 - {{\sum_{y_i - y_{Prediction}}^2} \over {\sum_{y_i - \bar y}^2}} $$

Where,  
\\(y_i\\) = each data point  
\\(y_{Prediction}\\) = Value predicted by the regression model  
\\(\bar y\\) = mean value of y's  


What is the range of values R<sup>2</sup> can take?
