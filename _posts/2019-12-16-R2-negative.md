## Can R<sup>2</sup> value ever be negative?

In a regression model, R<sup>2</sup> determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. To know more about R-squared and it's limiations, refer to [this](https://thinkdatascience.github.io/posts/R2andAdjustedR2/) link.

R^2 is given by below formula:
\\( R-squared = 1 - (SS<sub>Regression</sub> \over SS<sub>Total</sub> )\\)
