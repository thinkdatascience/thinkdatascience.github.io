<b>Feature Selection</b> is the process of choosing only a subset of features(or variables) that are relavant in predicting the target variable. But why is it required ? When you are working with a lot of features, it is common that some of them aren't useful in predictions. Alternately, it is also possible that using a lot of features can lead to overfitting, making your model product suboptimal results. Another common problem of working with large number of features is [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality).
