## Can R<sup>2</sup> value ever be negative?

In a regression model, R<sup>2</sup> determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. To know more about R-squared and it's limiations, refer to [this](https://thinkdatascience.github.io/posts/R2andAdjustedR2/) link.


$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$         
R^2 is given by below formula:

$$ R^2 = {1 - SS_Regression \over SS_Total} $$
